I did my BSc. and MSc. studies in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Middle East Technical University, Turkey. While doing my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to the world of nuclear receptors during my internship at the University of Bergen, Norway, where I worked on the tissue specific methylation of the Sf-1 gene. The field of nuclear receptors met my other passion of epigenetic gene regulation during my Master's studies, where I worked on mechanisms of the regulation of the expression of an E2-ER regulated gene, CXXC5. I joined Lack Laboratory in March 2022 as a Ph.D. student.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy watching movies (especially festival movies) and watching all types of sports (yes, even curling). Also, I do radio-show hosting as a hobby at CiTR 101.9FM Vancovuer.
