<p>
I got my BSc from Istanbul Bilgi University in 2021 with a major in Genetics and Bioengineering and a minor in Computer Engineering, so I guess working in bioinformatics makes sense for me :) For my bachelor’s senior project, I worked on the in silico engineering of an anti-human-IgG nanobody using homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. I also worked on quantification of the effect of consanguinity on developmental genetics signatures during my internship at the King Faisal Hospital and Research Center. I officially joined Lack Lab as a dry lab PhD student in 2022 and am currently working on projects involving STARR-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq data analysis and visualization. Don’t let the nerdy/geeky façade fool you ;) I also love playing the guitar, meditating, cooking, and going on adventures!
