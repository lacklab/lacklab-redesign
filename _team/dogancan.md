<p>
I graduated from Istanbul Bilgi University with a Genetics and Bioengineering degree in 2015. I did a summer research at Marine Biological Laboratory in 2014 studying microbial ecology. I joined Lack Lab in April 2016 as a PhD student in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering program and graduated in December 2021. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in Lack Lab and Collins Lab in Vancouver Prostate Centre.
I’m working on the genome organization of prostate cancer and trying to understand the underlying mechanisms of AR-driven transcription. I am using 3C-based technologies as well as large-scale the CRISPR screens.
