<p>
I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a B.Sc. in Biology. I then obtained a M.Sc. in Reproductive Biology from Imperial College London., and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from National Taiwan University/Academia Sinica. My previous work was focused on characterizing protein-protein interactions and their related functions in the inflammatory signaling pathway.
After several years of studying and working aboard, I recently moved back to Vancouver and joined the Lack Lab to identify and study how some Androgen Receptor (AR) binding sites act as cis-regulatory enhancers to impact the AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer development and progression.
Apart from working in the lab, I enjoy playing the piano, playing badminton, and taking walks with my dogs. I also like trying new food with my family and friends, and watching movies as a blanket burrito.
