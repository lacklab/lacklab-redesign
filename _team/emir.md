I studied Bioengineering for BSc in Yildiz Technical University and during my time as an exchange student in Poland, I got into bioinformatics. My first project was about the functional annotation of N-termini of NLR proteins in fungi through homology. Towards the end of my bachelor's, I started developing an interest for machine learning and its applications in biology so I shaped my BSc project around that. I joined Lack Lab as a dry lab PhD student in February 2021. Here, I'm working on deciphering the non-coding grammar and enhancer usage with machine learning.
Apart from that, I enjoy cold weather, listening to music (King Gizzard and the Lizzard Wizard is my jam), playing Guitar Hero, collecting vinyl records, and food :)
