During the course of my BSc in Honours Biology at UBC, I took on two co-op positions, the first of which involved research regarding telomeres and cytogenetics in multiple myeloma and breast cancer, and the second of which led me to conduct my Honours thesis research in the Lack Lab. Upon graduating from UBC in 2020, I joined Dr. Nathan Lackâ€™s lab as an MSc student (Experimental Medicine) in September of the same year. My project currently focuses on the identification of novel ARv7 co-regulators. However, given my broad interests, I spend much of my spare time reading about topics as diverse as invertebrate zoology, forensic anthropology and colonialism. I also enjoy creative writing, swimming, trying new recipes, and having ice cream - even in the dead of winter!
