I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Molecular Biology and Genetics department at Koc University. During my MSc, I worked on a new class photolyase in Vibrio cholerae. In this, we identified and characterized a bacterial 6-4 photolyase functioning in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. I joined Lack Lab in September 2019 as a PhD student in Experimental Medicine.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and fishing. I am also interested in martial arts, particularly krav maga and muay thai.
