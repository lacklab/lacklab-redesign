I hold a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from Middle East Technical University. During my undergrad years, I got involved in several bioinformatics projects related to antique DNA, microbial meta DNA analysis for zoonotic diseases and identifying candidate causative genes for genetic rare disease. I am currently focusing on functional genomics with Dr. Lack, where our main focus is understanding the transcriptional machinery and proposing therapeutics for cancer treatment. For my thesis, I am comparing the functional roles of androgen receptor (AR) binding sites within AR cistrome in LNCaP cells and supporting this model with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites within GR cistrome in A549 cells.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy travelling to cities that I haven't been to. Also I love photography, I do both analog and digital photography (I develop my films myself :) ). I take photos of architectural buildings, natural scenes and streets.
