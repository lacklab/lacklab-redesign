I got my BSc degree in Biology from Middle East Technical University in 2022. I worked in three different projects focusing on structural biology, plant genetics and breast cancer as an undergraduate research intern. During my internships, I realized I really like bioinformatics and biological data analysis in general. I joined Lack Lab in October 2022 as a dry lab PhD student. Right now in the lab, I am focused on STARR-seq and ChIP-seq analysis and data visualization. I look forward to many things I will be learning in the near future and where this journey will take me in the long run. In my free time, I love reading philosophical and science fiction books - Hermann Hesse and H. G. Wells are my favorites, respectively :). I also enjoy spending time in nature, hiking and camping.
